## Project info
This project is mainly focused on the area where storage of large amount of data  is required, and to handle such a huge amount of data in the traditional way was very tedious thing. the employee who kept all these data was always frustrated and he always makes silly mistakes which was a very serious issue.
So, order to resolve this issue I develope an application which will store all the huge amount of data in a single chick with full security and easy to access. also to reduce extra burden and dependencies on humans.
## Features Of Application
* To show relevent data to the relevent user
* Three types of login mechanism
* Login As Owner (is an authorized user for the application which has full authority to add/remove admin, add/remove villagers of any village, permission to read data)
* Login As Admin (There will be only one admin for any village which will assigned by only the owner of the application and the admin has the permission to manipulate 		data of only one village which will assigned by the Owner only).
* Login As General (Any person login as general and he has only the permission to read and search data. He will not make any changes to data of any village)
* Quick Access (you can featch the data of any village/person/admin/resources/emergency contact etc... jut by one click)
* Full security
* Password rechecking
* No redudant data is allowed
* Various types of search mechanism (you can search in this application on various conditions like: search by name/father name/ mother name/ age(<,>,=)/ID/gender/religion/category/profession etc
* Resources section (in this section you can easily find out about all the resources of any village just by only one click).
